- index.html is fully converted
- All pages use the same Tailwind CSS styling and structure as the CIC website
- Social media links need to be updated to Newport's accounts
- Some content references may need manual review (e.g., specific Cardiff locations, events, etc.)

## Recommended Approach

Use your IDE's find-and-replace feature with "Replace All" for each of the replacements listed above across all the remaining HTML files. This will ensure consistency and save time.
